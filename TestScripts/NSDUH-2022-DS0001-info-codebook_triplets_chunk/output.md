A poverty level less than 100% indicates having a family income less than the poverty threshold and therefore defined by the Federal government as living in poverty. A poverty level greater than 100% indicates having a family income greater than the poverty threshold. The previously created variable POVERTY2 was created using the recoded version of family income that had a top-coded level of $100,000 or more. Starting in 2015, the family income questions were revised to expand the top level to include the responses $100,000 - $149,999 and $150,000 or more. The variable POVERTY3 accounts for these additional income levels through the use of the finer family income variable.

Based on the NDSS, a respondent was defined as having nicotine dependence, NDSSDEP=1, if the sum of the valid responses (based on actual reporting) was greater than or equal to 46.75. The FTND measure is defined by assessing how soon after waking a respondent had their first cigarette (CIGWAKE). Based on the FTND scale, a respondent was defined as having nicotine dependence, FTNDDEP=1, if the first cigarette was smoked within 30 minutes of waking up on the days they smoked (CIGWAKE=1 or 2) and the respondent smoked cigarettes in the past month (CIGMON=1). Based on the NDSS and the FTND, a respondent who smoked cigarettes in the past month was defined as having nicotine dependence, PMNICDEP=1, if they met either the NDSS or the FTND criteria for dependence.

For this variable, 'occasion' means at the same time or within a couple hours of each other. Prior to 2015, 'binge' alcohol frequency was defined as the number of days in the past month on which the respondent reported drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion for everyone, regardless of sex.

These questions include the following symptoms of distress: feeling nervous (IRDSTNV30), feeling hopeless (IRDSTHP30), feeling restless or fidgety (IRDSTRB30), feeling so depressed that nothing could cheer you up (IRDSTCHR30), feeling that everything was an effort (IRDSTEFF30), and feeling down on yourself, no good, or worthless (IRDSTGD30). For each of the six items listed above, responses of “all of the time“ were coded 4, “most of the time“ were coded 3, “some of the time“ were coded 2, “a little of the time“ were coded 1, and “none of the time“ were coded 0.
