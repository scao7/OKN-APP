"Survey History"
"N-SSATS has evolved from national survey efforts begun in the 1970s by the National Institute on"
"Drug Abuse (NIDA) to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United"
"States. The sixth of these surveys, conducted in 1976, introduced the data elements and format that"
"have formed the core of subsequent surveys. These include organizational focus, service orientation,"
"services available, clients in treatment by type of care, and hospital inpatient/residential capacity."
"The 1976 survey, called the National Drug Abuse Treatment Utilization Survey, was repeated in"
"1977 and 1978."
"In 1979, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) became a co-sponsor of"
"the survey, alcoholism treatment facilities were added, and the study was renamed the National Drug"
"and Alcoholism Treatment Utilization Survey. This survey was repeated in 1980 and 1982. In 1984,"
"a one-page version called the National Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Program Inventory was used. In"
"1987, the full version of the survey was reinstated and renamed the National Drug and Alcoholism"
"Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS). NDATUS was conducted annually from 1989 to 1993."
"In  1992,  with  the  creation  of  SAMHSA,  responsibility  for  conducting  the  survey  shifted  to"
"SAMHSAâ€™s Office of Applied Studies (now the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality)."
"The survey was redesigned, and it was conducted annually as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)"
"survey from 1995 to 1998. During these years, the survey was conducted by mail with telephone"
"follow-up of non-respondents. The 1999 survey year was a transition year during which the survey"
"was redesigned and an abbreviated telephone survey of treatment facilities was conducted. In 2000,"
"a redesigned full mail survey was reinstated with telephone follow-up; it was renamed the National"
"Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS). The reference date for the annual survey"
"had always been the end of September or beginning of October. After the 2000 survey, the reference"
"date was changed to the end of March, and no survey was conducted during 2001."
"In 2000, the use of an Internet-based questionnaire was tested; beginning in 2002, all facilities were"
"offered the opportunity to respond via the Internet."
"Since 2013, the full N-SSATS questionnaire (with client counts) has alternated with an abbreviated"
"version of the questionnaire. The full questionnaire, fielded in odd-numbered years, collects data on"
"programs and clients; in alternate (even-numbered) years, an abbreviated N-SSATS questionnaire"
"collects the program information needed to update the substance abuse section of the Behavioral"
"Health Treatment Services Locator and collects information on other facility-related topics."
