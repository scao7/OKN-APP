"As with any data collection effort, certain procedural considerations and data limitations must be"
"taken into account when interpreting data from the 2020 N-SSATS."
"(cid:404)  N-SSATS attempts to obtain responses from all known treatment facilities, but it is a voluntary"
"survey. There was no adjustment for the 10 percent facility non-response."
"(cid:404)  N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment"
"system  and  its  clients on the reference date.  Client  counts  reported  do  not  represent  annual"
"totals.  Rather,  N-SSATS  provides  a  “snapshot”  of  substance  abuse  treatment  facilities  and"
"clients on an average day."
"(cid:404)  Multiple responses were allowed for certain variables (e.g., services provided and specialized"
"programs). Tabulations of these variables include the total number of facilities reporting each"
"response."
