"Data collection"
"Until  1996,  state  substance  abuse  agencies  distributed  and  collected  the  facility  survey  forms."
"Beginning in 1996, data collection was centralized; since that time, SAMHSA has mailed survey"
"forms  directly  to  and  collected  forms  directly  from  the  facilities  and  has  conducted  follow-up"
"telephone interviews with the facility director or his/her designee. In 2000, SAMHSA introduced"
"an online trial web version of the questionnaire for a few facilities in addition to the hard copy"
"questionnaire. The web version of the questionnaire was fully implemented in 2002. The proportion"
"of  facilities  using  the  web  survey  to  respond  to  N-SSATS  has  increased  steadily  since  its  full"
"inception in 2002."
"Non-response"
"Beginning in 1992, SAMHSA expanded efforts to obtain information from non-responding facilities."
"A representative sample of non-respondents was contacted and administered an abbreviated version"
"of the survey instrument via telephone. In 1993 and later years, this effort was extended to all non-"
"responding facilities. In 1997, a series of measures was introduced to enhance the survey response"
"rate. These included advance notification and improved methods for updating address and contact"
"information.  Between  2004  and  2019,  use  of  these  methods  and  intensive  telephone  follow-up"
"resulted in an annual follow-up rate (i.e., facilities in the sample either completed the survey or"
"were determined to be closed or otherwise ineligible) of 92 to 96 percent. In 2020, the final response"
"rate, counting eligible facilities, was 90 percent."
"Exclusions"
"In 1997, facilities offering only DUI/DWI programs were excluded; these facilities were reinstated"
"in 1998."
"Facilities  operated  by  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  (BOP)  were  excluded  from  the  1997  survey  and"
"subsequent  surveys  because  SAMHSA  conducted  a  separate  survey  of  correctional  facilities.3"
"During that survey, it was discovered that jails, prisons, and other organizations treating incarcerated"
"persons only were poorly enumerated on the inventory. Beginning in 1999, these facilities were"
"identified during the survey and excluded from analyses and public use data files."
"I-BHS and N-SSATS are designed to include specialty substance abuse treatment facilities rather"
"than individuals. Solo practitioners are listed on I-BHS and surveyed in N-SSATS only if the state"
"substance abuse agency explicitly requests that they be included."
"Beginning in 2000, halfway houses that did not provide substance abuse treatment were included"
"on the inventory and in N-SSATS so that they could be listed in the National Directory of Drug and"
"Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities (formerly the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse"
"Treatment Programs) and on the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator (https://findtreatment."
"samhsa.gov). These facilities are excluded from analyses and public use data files."
