"reminder letters were sent to all facilities. Approximately eight weeks after the initial packet mailing,"
"a second packet was sent to newly added facilities. About three weeks after the second packet"
"mailing, non-respondents received a reminder telephone call. A third packet containing a hard copy"
"questionnaire was mailed about eight weeks after the second packet mailing. Those facilities that"
"had not completed the survey by July 13, 2020, received reminder calls and were asked to complete"
"the survey by computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)."
"Quality assurance"
"The web questionnaire was programmed to be self-editing; that is, respondents were prompted to"
"complete missing responses and to confirm or correct inconsistent responses."
"All mail questionnaires were reviewed manually for consistency and for missing data. Calls were"
"made to facilities to resolve unclear responses and to obtain missing data. After data entry, automated"
"quality  assurance  reviews  were  conducted.  The  reviews  incorporated  the  rules  used  in  manual"
"editing, plus consistency checks and checks for data outliers not readily identified by manual review."
"Item non-response was minimized through editing and extensive follow-up. The item response rate"
"for the 2020 N-SSATS averaged more than 99 percent across 322 separate items."
"F
acility status and response rate"
"Table 1.1  presents  a summary of  response  rate information. There were  19,926 facilities in the"
"survey universe. Of these facilities, 1,742 facilities (9 percent) were found to be ineligible for the"
"survey because they had closed or did not provide substance abuse treatment or detoxification. Of"
"the remaining 18,184 facilities, 16,394 facilities (90 percent) completed the survey, and 16,066"
"(88 percent) were included in the 2020 N-SSATS report."
