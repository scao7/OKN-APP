"N-SSATS in the Context of the Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS)"
"N-SSATS is one of the components of SAMHSA’s Behavioral Health Services Information System"
"(BHSIS). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Behavioral Health Services (I-BHS), a continuously"
"updated, comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities and mental health"
"treatment  facilities.  The  other  substance  abuse  component  of  BHSIS  is  the  Treatment  Episode"
"Data Set (TEDS), a client-level database of admissions to and discharges from substance abuse"
"treatment. Together, the components provide national- and state-level information on the numbers"
"and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment programs and describe"
"the facilities that deliver care to those individuals."
"I-BHS is the list frame for N-SSATS. Facilities in I-BHS fall into two general categories and are"
"distinguished by the relationship of the facility to its state substance abuse agency. These categories"
"are described below."
"Treatment facilities approved by state substance abuse agencies"
"The largest group of facilities (16,856 in 2020) includes facilities that are licensed, certified, or"
"otherwise approved by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment. State"
"BHSIS representatives maintain this segment of I-BHS by reporting new facilities, closures, and"
"address changes to SAMHSA. Some facilities are not licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by"
"the state agency. Some private for-profit facilities fall into this category. The approved facility group"
"also includes programs operated by federal agencies—the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),"
"the Department of Defense, the Indian Health Service—and opioid treatment programs certified"
"by SAMHSA. I-BHS records for federally operated facilities are updated annually through lists"
"provided by these agencies."
"Treatment facilities not approved by state substance abuse agencies"
"This group of  facilities (3,070 in 2020) represents the SAMHSA effort since the mid-1990s to"
"make I-BHS as comprehensive as possible by including treatment facilities that state substance"
"abuse agencies, for a variety of reasons, do not fund, license, or certify. Many of these facilities are"
"private for-profit, small group practices, or hospital-based programs. Most of them are identified"
"through periodic screening of alternative source databases. (See Special efforts to improve survey"
"coverage.) State substance abuse agencies are given the opportunity to review these facilities and"
"to add them to the state agency-approved list, if appropriate."
"Survey Coverage"
"The use of I-BHS as the list frame for N-SSATS imposes certain constraints related to the unit of"
"response and the scope of facilities included. In addition, the expansion of I-BHS in recent years to"
"provide a more complete enumeration of substance abuse treatment facilities means that year-to-year"
"comparisons of the numbers of facilities reporting to N-SSATS must be interpreted with caution."
"Unit of response"
"N-SSATS  is  designed  to  collect  data  from  each  physical  location  where  treatment  services  are"
"provided. Accordingly, SAMHSA requests that state substance abuse agencies use the point of"
